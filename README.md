# SMS Spam Classifier

This Python script analyzes SMS messages to classify them as spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following libraries:
   - pandas
   - NLTK
   - scikit-learn

   You can install them using pip:

2. **Download NLTK Data**: NLTK requires additional data to be downloaded. Run the following commands in a Python shell or script to download the required corpus:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```
3. **Feel free to customize this README file further based on your specific project details and requirements.**
```python
python sms_spam_classifier.py
```
